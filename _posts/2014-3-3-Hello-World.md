## WHY YOU TOO SHOULD TURN VEGAN?
We have been raised into a society that has indoctrinated us into believing that seeking animal commodities is spontaneous and essential part of diet. For decades, we have disregarded the consideration of animal welfare - so much that it has been unnecessarily ghettoized. Hiding behind general consensus among gullible masses and ingrained justifications, the dairy industry has been perpetually exploiting animals for its own benefits. A meal to us lasts only for a few minutes - an inconsequential amount of time; but that meal has cost that animal its entire existence. How can we morally justify the killing of animals for the sole purpose of tantalizing our taste buds. The fact that like humans, animals also express a wide spectrum of emotions such as love, pain, grif and fear implies a natural tendency to avoid sufferings. However, unfortunately, we have normalised the exploitation of these peace-loving animals. To counter this appalling prevalence in society, one must conscientiously embrace veganism - the practice of abstaining oneself from the use of animal commodities.
