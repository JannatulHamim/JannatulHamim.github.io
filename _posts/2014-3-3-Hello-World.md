## WHY YOU TOO SHOULD TURN VEGAN?
We have been raised into a society that has indoctrinated us into believing that seeking animal commodities is spontaneous and essential part of diet. For decades, we have disregarded the consideration of animal welfare - so much that it has been unnecessarily ghettoized. Hiding behind general consensus among gullible masses and ingrained justifications, the dairy industry has been perpetually exploiting animals for its own benefits. A meal to us lasts only for a few minutes - an inconsequential amount of time; but that meal has cost that animal its entire existence. How can we morally justify the killing of animals for the sole purpose of tantalizing our taste buds? The fact that like humans, animals also express a wide spectrum of emotions such as love, pain, grif and fear implies a natural tendency to avoid sufferings. However, unfortunately, we have normalised the exploitation of these peace-loving animals. To counter this appalling prevalence in society, one must conscientiously embrace veganism - the practice of abstaining oneself from the use of animal commodities.


The shift from animal-based diet to vegan diet is explicit opposing of animal cruelty and persecution. The stereotypical depiction of vegetarians as pale, weak and skinny is one of the many animal agriculture propagandas we are being force-fed. When it comes to health, a plant-based diet has been proved to be not only healthy but also nutritionally adequate for all stages of life, including infancy and pregnancy, as stated by the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Moreover, getting nutrients from plant foods allows more room in your diet for health-promoting options like vegetables, fruits and whole grains which are brimmed with beneficial fibre, vitamins and minerals. Besides, the risk of developing chronic illnesses such as cardiovascular diseases,diabetes and even cancer can be reduced significantly. By switching to vegan diet one can take a stand against existing unsustainable food system.
