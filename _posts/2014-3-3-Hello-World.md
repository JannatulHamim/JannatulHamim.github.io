## WHY YOU TOO SHOULD TURN VEGAN?
We have been raised into a society that has indoctrinated us into believing that seeking animal commodities is spontaneous and essential part of our diet. For decades, we have disregarded the consideration of animal welfare - so much that it has been unnecessarily ghettoized. Hiding behind general consensus among gullible masses and ingrained justifications, the dairy industry has been perpetually exploiting animals for its own benefits. A meal to us lasts only for a few minutes - an inconsequential amount of time; but that meal has cost that animal its entire existence. How can we morally justify the killing of animals for the sole purpose of tantalizing our taste buds? The fact that like humans, animals also express a wide spectrum of emotions such as love, pain, grief and fear implies that they too have a natural tendency to avoid suffering. However, unfortunately, we have normalised the exploitation of these peace-loving animals. To counter this appalling prevalence in society, one must conscientiously embrace veganism - the practice of abstaining oneself from the use of animal products.

The shift from animal-based diet to vegan diet is explicit opposing of animal cruelty and persecution. The stereotypical depiction of vegetarians as pale, weak and malnourished is one of the many animal agriculture propagandas we are being force-fed. When it comes to health, a plant-based diet has been proved to be not only healthy but also nutritionally adequate for all stages of life, including infancy and pregnancy, as stated by the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Moreover, acquiring nutrients from plant foods allows more space in your diet to provide health-promoting options like vegetables, legumes, fruits and whole grains which are brimmed with beneficial fibre, vitamins and minerals. Besides, the risk of developing chronic illnesses such as cardiovascular diseases,diabetes and even cancer can be reduced significantly. By switching to a vegan diet one can take a stand against the existing unsustainable food system.

The mass production of animal commodities places a heavy load on the already devastated environment. Woefully, the staggering quantity of grain feed needed to meet meat production is a major contributor to deforestation, habitat destruction, oceanic dead zones, species extinction and accounts for greenhouse gas emission which equates to the entire transportation system combined. The good news is a plant-based diet requires only one-third of the land needed to support a meat and dairy diet. According to prominent researchers at Oxford University, if everyone stopped animal-based diet, the global farmland use could be reduced by 75 per cent, an area equivalent to the size of the USA, China, Australia and the EU combined.Thus, a vegan diet could be the most effective way to reduce our environmental impact on Earth.

The unimaginable hardships farm animals go through are horrifying. We cannot base our morality on the actions of primitive ancestors - who used to be obligate carnivores - where the modern day notion of right and wrong didn't exist. So, everytime you make a purchase in a supermarket - no matter how trivial the item may be - ponder whether the item has a negative effect on other sentient beings.

## Gender Dysphoria
Gender dysphoria refers to the psychological distress that results from an incongruence
between oneâ€™s sex assigned at birth and gender identity. This conflict between the sexual
characteristics of their physical body and how they feel and think about themselves causes
anxiety and depression which eventually lead them to be alienated from society. Not only are
gender non-conforming individuals vulnerable to stigma and discrimination but are also at
higher risk of being victims of violence or bullying.

The onset of dysphoria is often during early childhood but can also emerge during the
teenage years. This might be visible in their behaviours such as dressing as their preferred
gender, playing with toys that are typically associated with the opposite gender, and rejection
of many gender-stereotypical behaviors. Symptoms of gender dysphoria can manifest in
mainly two forms- 1)A strong desire to rid of primary sexual characteristics.2) A strong desire
to be the other gender and be treated as the other gender.

The exact causes of gender dysphoria are not completely understood but studies have
shown that genetics, hormonal influences during prenatal development and environmental
factors may be contributing factors to gender identity disorders.
Treatment can help them to explore their gender identity and find the gender role that feels
comfortable for them, easing distress. But it is important to consider that treatment can be
individualized. Treatment options might include home therapy, surgery and behavioural
therapy. As a society it should be our responsibility to listen to their struggles and help them
feel more fulfilled so that they can overcome the discomfort and freely express their
identities.

We have been raised into a society that has indoctrinated us into believing that gender
dysphoria is just a mental disorder. This trivializes the struggles of LGBTQ community and
instigates further discrimination against them which is rampant in our society. Unfortunately,
homophobia is still one of the last acceptable forms of bigotry in some regions but our hope
is that it soon changes.
