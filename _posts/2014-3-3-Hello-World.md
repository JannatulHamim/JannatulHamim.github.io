## WHY YOU TOO SHOULD TURN VEGAN?
We have been raised into a society that has indoctrinated us into believing that seeking animal commodities is spontaneous and essential part of our diet. For decades, we have disregarded the consideration of animal welfare - so much that it has been unnecessarily ghettoized. Hiding behind general consensus among gullible masses and ingrained justifications, the dairy industry has been perpetually exploiting animals for its own benefits. A meal to us lasts only for a few minutes - an inconsequential amount of time; but that meal has cost that animal its entire existence. How can we morally justify the killing of animals for the sole purpose of tantalizing our taste buds? The fact that like humans, animals also express a wide spectrum of emotions such as love, pain, grief and fear implies that they too have a natural tendency to avoid suffering. However, unfortunately, we have normalised the exploitation of these peace-loving animals. To counter this appalling prevalence in society, one must conscientiously embrace veganism - the practice of abstaining oneself from the use of animal products.

The shift from animal-based diet to vegan diet is explicit opposing of animal cruelty and persecution. The stereotypical depiction of vegetarians as pale, weak and malnourished is one of the many animal agriculture propagandas we are being force-fed. When it comes to health, a plant-based diet has been proved to be not only healthy but also nutritionally adequate for all stages of life, including infancy and pregnancy, as stated by the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Moreover, acquiring nutrients from plant foods allows more space in your diet to provide health-promoting options like vegetables, legumes, fruits and whole grains which are brimmed with beneficial fibre, vitamins and minerals. Besides, the risk of developing chronic illnesses such as cardiovascular diseases,diabetes and even cancer can be reduced significantly. By switching to a vegan diet one can take a stand against the existing unsustainable food system.

The mass production of animal commodities places a heavy load on the already devastated environment. Woefully, the staggering quantity of grain feed needed to meet meat production is a major contributor to deforestation, habitat destruction, oceanic dead zones, species extinction and accounts for greenhouse gas emission which equates to the entire transportation system combined. The good news is a plant-based diet requires only one-third of the land needed to support a meat and dairy diet. According to prominent researchers at Oxford University, if everyone stopped animal-based diet, the global farmland use could be reduced by 75 per cent, an area equivalent to the size of the USA, China, Australia and the EU combined.Thus, a vegan diet could be the most effective way to reduce our environmental impact on Earth.

The unimaginable hardships farm animals go through are horrifying. We cannot base our morality on the actions of primitive ancestors - who used to be obligate carnivores - where the modern day notion of right and wrong didn't exist. So, everytime you make a purchase in a supermarket - no matter how trivial the item may be - ponder whether the item has a negative effect on other sentient beings.
